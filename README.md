      <p>My name is Rob Morganti, currently living in Media, Pennsylvania. 
        After obtaining my BS in Business from Mount St. Mary's University in Maryland, 
        I went to work for a large investment company in the Philadelphia area for about 9 years. 
        Although I held multiple positions over my time there, my most recent positon was working as a project manager for distributors of College Savings Plans. My family is my favorite thing in the world, followed by my close friends, golfing, snowboarding, cooking, going out to new Restuarants, and early morning walks.
